<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to implement the drag-and-drop capability to re-order rows and drop them onto an external control</h1>
<p>We have implemented GridDragDropManager behavior in the grid extentions library. This attached behavior allows you to include the drag and drop support in your application more easily than the old approach.

This description is actual only for versions earlier than 12.1.:
The following example demonstrates how to implement the drag-and-drop capability to allow end-users to do the following:
1. re-order grid rows;
2. drag any grid row from a grid and drop it onto an external control.

To accomplish this task, it is necessary to set the GridView.AllowDrop property to True and handle its PreviewMouseDown, PreviewMouseMove, DragOver, and Drop events as shown in this example.</p>
